Greasemonkey is a user script manager for Firefox.
User scripts are small browser extensions that let you customize your
web browsing experience.


This is a fork of Greasemonkey for UXP-based browsers (Pale moon, Basilisk, etc...), contains code from janekptacijarabaci's version of Greasemonkey (https://github.com/janekptacijarabaci/greasemonkey/) while expanding it with newer features and enhancements from the upstream version of Greasemonkey (https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey).
